*Buddha*
Theravāda (Sanskrit: थेरवाद, Pali, literally "school of the elder monks") is a branch of Buddhism that uses the teaching of the Pāli Canon, a collection of the oldest recorded Buddhist texts, as its doctrinal core, but also includes a rich diversity of traditions and practices that have developed over its long history of interactions with cultures and communities.

*Dhamma*
It is the dominant form of religion in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is practiced by minority groups in Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, Nepal, and Vietnam. In addition, the diaspora of all of these groups as well as converts around the world practise Theravāda Buddhism.

*Nibbana* ('užgesimas')

*Arahat*

Appam pi ce saṃhitaṃ bhāsamāno dhammassa hoti anudhammacārī, rāgañ ca dosañ ca pahāya mohaṃ sammāppajāno suvimuttacitto, anupādiyāno idha vā huraṃ vā sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.
