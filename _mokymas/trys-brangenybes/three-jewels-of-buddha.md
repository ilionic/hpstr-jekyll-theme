The Three Jewels, also called the Three Treasures, Three Refuges, Precious Triad, or most commonly the Triple Gem Pali: Tiratana, Sanskrit: त्रिरत्न (triratna), are the three things that Buddhists take refuge in, and look toward for guidance, in the process known as taking refuge.

The Three Jewels are:

Buddha
Sanskrit, Pali: The Enlightened or Awakened One; Chinese: 佛陀, Fótuó, Korean: 불, Japanese: 仏, Butsu, Standard Tibetan: sangs-rgyas, Mongolian: burqan
Depending on one's interpretation, it can mean the historical Buddha (Siddharta) or the Buddha nature — the ideal or highest spiritual potential that exists within all beings;
Dharma
Sanskrit: The Teaching; Pali: Dhamma, Chinese: 法, Fǎ, Korean: 법, Japanese: 法, Hō, Standard Tibetan: chos, Mongolian: nom
The teachings of the Buddha, the path to Enlightenment.
Sangha
Sanskrit, Pali: The Community; Chinese: 僧, Sēng, Korean: 승, Japanese: 僧, Sō, Standard Tibetan: dge-'dun, Mongolian: quvara
The community of those who have attained enlightenment, who may help a practicing Buddhist to do the same. Also used more broadly to refer to the community of practicing Buddhists, or the community of Buddhist monks and nuns.
